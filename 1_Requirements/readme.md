### MINI CALCULATOR

## Introduction

 A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More sophisticated calculators can handle exponent ial operations, roots, logarithm s, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions.
 The purpose of a calculator is to do correct calculations, and to do so efficiently. It is clear that a calculator should relieve the user of the need to do mental operations and of the need to rely on paper, so far as possible.
